# Security Policy

## Privacy-First Design

Kite Personal Finance Manager is built with privacy and security as core principles:

- **Local-Only Data**: All financial data remains on your device using IndexedDB
- **No External Servers**: No data transmission to external services
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, telemetry, or user tracking
- **Open Source**: Transparent codebase for security audit

## Current Security Features (v1.0)

### Data Storage
- **IndexedDB**: Browser's secure local storage
- **Same-Origin Policy**: Protected by browser security model
- **HTTPS Only**: Production deployment over secure connections
- **No Persistence Outside Browser**: Data cleared when browser storage is cleared

### Client-Side Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Subresource Integrity**: Ensures script integrity
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All resources loaded over secure connections
- **No External Dependencies at Runtime**: All assets bundled and served locally

## Future Security Enhancements (v2.0+)

### End-to-End Encryption (Planned)
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Industry-standard symmetric encryption
- **Per-Record IVs**: Unique initialization vectors for each data record
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 or Argon2 for password-based key generation
- **Envelope Encryption**: Separate keys for different data types

### Multi-Device Sync (Planned)
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server cannot decrypt user data
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption/decryption happens on device
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Regular key rotation
- **Device Authentication**: Public key cryptography for device trust

## Threat Model

### Threats We Protect Against
1. **Data Breach**: All data is local-only, no server to breach
2. **Man-in-the-Middle**: HTTPS and SRI prevent tampering
3. **XSS Attacks**: CSP and React's built-in XSS protection
4. **Malicious Scripts**: No external script loading, bundled assets only

### Current Limitations
1. **Device Loss/Theft**: Data accessible if device is unlocked
2. **Browser Vulnerabilities**: Dependent on browser security
3. **Malware**: Local malware could potentially access browser storage
4. **Physical Access**: No device-level encryption beyond OS features

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability:

### Reporting Process
1. **Do NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email**: security@kite-pfm.dev (if project has email)
3. **GitHub**: Use private security advisory feature
4. **Include**: Detailed description, steps to reproduce, impact assessment

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Based on severity (critical: days, others: weeks)
- **Disclosure**: After fix is available and deployed

### Scope
Security issues in scope:
- Authentication bypasses
- Data exposure vulnerabilities  
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Cryptographic weaknesses (when implemented)

Out of scope:
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical device security
- Browser/OS vulnerabilities
- Third-party service vulnerabilities

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Device Security
- Keep your device and browser updated
- Use device lock screens and biometric authentication
- Be cautious on shared/public devices
- Regular device security scans

### Browser Security
- Keep browser updated to latest version
- Use reputable browsers with good security track record
- Be aware of browser extensions that might access data
- Clear browser data when using shared devices

### Data Backup
- Export data regularly as backup
- Store exports securely (encrypted)
- Test restore process periodically
- Consider multiple backup locations

## Compliance and Standards

### Current Compliance
- **GDPR Ready**: No personal data transmission or processing outside device
- **Privacy by Design**: Built with privacy as default
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Transparency**: Open source code for full transparency

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Following web application security best practices
- **CSP Level 3**: Modern Content Security Policy implementation
- **SRI**: Subresource Integrity for all external resources
- **HTTPS**: Transport Layer Security for all communications

## Security Roadmap

### v1.1 (Next Release)
- [ ] Enhanced CSP policies
- [ ] Security headers audit
- [ ] Automated security scanning in CI
- [ ] Regular dependency updates

### v2.0 (Future)
- [ ] Client-side encryption implementation
